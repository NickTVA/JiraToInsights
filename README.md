# JIRA To Insights

The JIRA to Insights Integration is a Node.JS service hosted on Heroku. The service endpoint expects a POST message from JIRA's Webhook, parses the data and sends it to Insights.

More information on JIRA's Webhook settings can be found here: https://developer.atlassian.com/jiradev/jira-apis/webhooks
